# Time-Series-Prediction-with-LSTM
In this time series data we have two columns; first one is Date and second one is the Electric power production value. In this project, First we loaded the data, looked into it and plotted it to feel it. We see that the over the years the value increased. We split the last two year's data for testing and used tensorflows timeseries generator for preprocessing the data. For modeling I used LSTM and created checkpoints to store the best weights in this learning. I plotted the training and validation loss and accuracy and lasly evaluated the models performance from the best model we stored earlier and plotted the prediction with training and test data.
